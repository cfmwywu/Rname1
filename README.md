SH1.EXE is a simple program that takes your Sugarhouse sportsbook betting
history and puts it into a database file and a spreadsheet file -
SH1.DBF and SH1.XLS. It doesn't quite do all the work. You have to have a
text file to start with. This is easy to do. I use the Firefox browser,
myself. Other browsers may work as well.
So, first, you log into your Sugarhouse account. Then get a listing of
your history from the Sugarhouse menu. Then, from the top menu bar, click
on File, and then click on Save Page As. Type in a file name and save as
type - text. The betting section of your text file should look something
like this:

You may save the text file anywhere. The SH1 program will open a standard
Open file dialog box for you. You double click on your text file and the
program does the rest. It displays info as it runs so you know that
